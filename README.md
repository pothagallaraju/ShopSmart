---------------------------------------
This is a modern e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase or MangoDB.

The application combines modern web technologies with AI capabilities to create an engaging shopping experience. Users can browse products, get AI-powered recommendations, manage their cart, and complete purchases, while administrators can manage inventory and track orders through a dedicated dashboard.

The Virtual Shopping Assistant project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a user-friendly interface to guide customers seamlessly through their shopping journey. The system leverages AI to provide personalized assistance through both voice and text-based interactions, ensuring a conversational and intuitive user experience.

Built with a robust technology stack, the project incorporates React for creating a responsive conversational interface, enabling smooth user interactions. Node.js serves as the backend to process customer queries, fetch product details, and manage transactions efficiently. The assistant offers intelligent product recommendations, answers customer queries in real time, and assists in completing purchases, ensuring a streamlined and engaging shopping process.

This solution is designed to enhance customer satisfaction by simulating the experience of a knowledgeable in-store assistant, making online shopping more interactive, personalized, and efficient. The project holds immense potential for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost customer engagement and conversion rates.
